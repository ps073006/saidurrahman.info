## Abstract

Modern webpages become complex and richer to provide full-feature contents. However, it decreases the site responsiveness due to the growing number of DNS lookups. As users and service providers want faster responsive websites, developers proposed several web performance metrics such as First Meaningful Paint, Page Load Time, and Speed Index to analyze the performance of websites. In this paper, we investigate the performance of different webpages using web performance metrics and provide a novel mechanism MR-DNS to reduce DNS lookups and improve web performance. MR-DNS provides multi-resolution service to reduce DNS lookups in the local DNS and reduces incoming traffic to Authoritative DNS. We also investigate memory and network traffic conditions for MR-DNS system.

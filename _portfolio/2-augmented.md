## Abstract

The popularity of Augmented Reality applications is increasing. People want real-time service, up-to-date and personalized information in Augmented Reality (AR). The communication in AR is a challenge due to the high latency between the device to cloud communication, especially in vehicular applications. Vehicular applications need real-time services and data abstraction with minimal latency. In this survey paper, we comprehensively investigate augmented reality communication and compare how other technologies handle the problems of serving the data in real-time and what are the challenges to implementing similar solutions in AR systems.
